Q. Do JS use compiler ?

No, It has JS engine( in google browser V8 is JS engine)  to run it ----> clinet side language ----> browser


Q. CPP + JS  ===>   Node Js  ---> server side ---> outside browser


JS setup

1. install VS code
2. install Node JS



1.What is JAvaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:

ECMAScript provides the core functionality.
The Document Object Model (DOM) provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
The Browser Object Model (BOM) provides the browser API for interacting with the web browser.

2.How JS runs?

The JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. In the beginning, JavaScript engines were implemented as interpreters.

However, modern JavaScript engines are typically implemented as just-in-time compilers that compile JavaScript code to bytecode for improved performance.


Q Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript

When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in web browsers. In this case, JavaScript works as a client-side language.

JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular JavaScript server-side environment is Node.js. Unlike client-side JavaScript, server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows you to access databases, file systems, etc.

Q Install a JavaScript Code Editor


Q Meet the Console Tab of Devtools

Q  Statements :- A statement is a code that declares a variable or instructs the JavaScript engine to do a task. A simple statement is terminated by a semicolon (;).
		Although the semicolon (;) is optional; you should always use it to terminate a statement. For example, the following declares a variable and shows it to the console:

						let message = "Welcome to JavaScript";
						console.log(message);

  Identifiers :-An identifier is a name you choose for variables, parameters, functions, classes, etc. 
		Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, the "message" is different from the "Message".

  Comments :- // this is a single-line comment
		
		/* This is a block comment
		that can span multiple lines */ 


-> Use whitespace including cariage return, space, newline, and tab to format the code. The JavaScript engine ignores the whiespace.
-> Use a semicolon (;) to terminate a simple statement.
-> Use the curly braces ({}) to form a block that groups one or more simple statments.
-> A single-line comment start with // followed by a text. A block comment begins with /* and ends with */. JavaScript engine also ignores the comments.
-> Identifers are names that you choose for variables, functions, classes, etc.
-> Do not use the reserved keywords and reserved words for identifers.
