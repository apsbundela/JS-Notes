1. What is Node.Js?

Ans : 
	Node.js is an open source server environment
	Node.js uses JavaScript on the server
	Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
	
For example JVM or JRE is server environment to run JAVA. Same for javascript, Node Js is one server environment.


2. Explain var in JS?
	
	-> var is keyword in Js to declare a variable.
	-> var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

	Problem with var

    		var greeter = "hey hi";
    		var times = 4;

    		if (times > 3) {
        	var greeter = "say Hello instead"; 
    		}
    
    		console.log(greeter) // "say Hello instead"

While this is not a problem if you knowingly want greeter to be redefined, it becomes a problem when you do not realize that a variable greeter has already been defined before.


3. Explain let in JS?

	 -> let is keyword in Js to declare a variable.

	 -> let is block scoped
	 	* A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.

	 -> let can be updated but not re-declared.
	 	* Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.


4. Explain Const in JS?
		
	 -> Variables declared with the const maintain constant values
	
	 -> const declarations are block scoped
		* like let
		
	-> const cannot be updated or re-declared

5. What will happen if we declare variable but not assigned any value?

	It will give "undefined". 

6. What it will print?
	
	myName = "Ayush"
	console.log("myName"); // Ayush


7. Explain typeof operator in Js

8. Is null and undefined are Data Type in JS?

9. what is typeof null?

10 When we use typof ?
	Suppose some value is coming from frontend (browser) to server	and we are not sure which Type it is to further operate then we use typof operator.

11. Suppose if I am getting value in string but want to convert it into number then how to DO?

	let score = "220";
	const intialScore = Number(score);
	console.log(typeof intialScore) // Number

12. What if the value from frontend in score is 
		let score = "12abc"

	then we can also validate 
	    const intialScore = Number(score);
    	console.log(intialScore);  // Nan  
	so we can check if the score in NaN then do this... or this..

13. Conversion to Number

	###	Number(valueToConvertInNumber)

	"33" => 33
	"33abc" => NaN
	null  => 0
	"" => 0
	undefined => NaN
	false => 0
	true => 1

14. Conversion to Boolean

		Boolean(valueToConvertBoolean)
	
	"33" => true
	"33abc" => true
	122 => true
	null  => false
	"" => false
	undefined => false
	true => true
	false => false


15. Conversion to String 

			String(valueToConvertString)

16. Is JavaScript dynamically typed or statically typed language?
    JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data 
	types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.

	let score = 45;
	Here we are not providing any type to score but this is number and if we assign like let score = "45" then it will be string so type is determined at runtime so it is dynamicallytyped language.

17. What is Differnce b/w == and === operator.
